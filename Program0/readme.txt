This program is the starting point of our assignments throughout CIS 200. Every program from here on after builds on the previous program. Program 0 uses multiple classes to calculate and display basic information on parcels. The Parcel class is the base class for various different options. This program only has Letters as a derived class, but later programs will add other parcels such as GroundPackage and AirPackage.
